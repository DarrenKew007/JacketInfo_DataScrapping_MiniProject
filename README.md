This is a simple mini project made using the UIPath Studio application, with the objective of automating data scrapping the Descriptions and costs of 500 Jackets on the online shopping website, E-Bay.

The work flow of the automation should go as follows:
"Using Google chrome -> entering E-Bay -> searching for jackets -> selecting the jacket descriptions and costs to extract -> extract the data into a csv file -> convert the csv data into a excel workbook(xlsx file) -> End"

Note:
If you intend to use the automomation I made, please change the folder/file names into the names of your own folder/file.
This project has taken some inspiration from the UIPath Studio Community.
